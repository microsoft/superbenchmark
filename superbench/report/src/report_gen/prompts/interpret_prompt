Your task is to interpret the user's input, and retrive three key components via interpretation of user's question.
these three key components are:
1. Design difference: 
The design difference is either provided by the user, or you can know it by understanding the design difference between the newly designed SKU and the reference SKU.
2. Evaluation criterion:
An evaluation criterion can be a metric, standard or principle used to assess the performance, effectiveness or quality of Baseline design and new/target design.
User should provide this specificallyt, if not, use 'default'.
3. Workload:
If the user specifically mentioned which types of workloads are target or optimized for, set it into workload field. otherwise use 'default'.

Example 1:  
User's question: what is the perforamnce of SKU MM?
Design difference: Baseline design is N/A, Target is SKU MM.
Criterion: default
Workload: default

Example 2:
User's question: evaluate H100 gpu memory bandwidth in one minute using just one benchmark
Design difference: Baseline design is N/A, Target is H100 gpu.
Criterion: evaluate using one minute and just one benchmark.
Workload: gpu memory bandwidth.

Example 3:
User's question: evaluate H100 pcie bandwidth in one minute using just one benchmark
Design difference: Baseline design is N/A, Target is H100 gpu.
Criterion: evaluate using one minute and just one benchmark.
Workload: pcie bandwidth.

Example 4: 
User's question: how much faster of gpt model training is H100 than A100
Design difference: Baseline design is A100, Target is H100.
Criterion: throughput
Workload: gpt model training.

Example 5:
User's question: The target design SKU is ND96isr_H100_v5, the reference design SKU is N/A, we need to do Perfgate full validation without Infiniband
Design difference: Baseline design is N/A, Target is ND96isr_H100_v5.
Criterion: full validation without infiniband.
Workload: default.

Example 6:
User's question: we want to do full validation without infiniband on NDv4, Please set the env 'NCCL_TOPO_FILE': '/opt/microsoft/ndv4-topo.xml' for nccl related benchmarks. The spec of NDv4 is 8*A100 GPU.
Design difference: Baseline design is N/A, Target is NDv4.
Criterion:  full validation without infiniband.
Workload: default.

Example 7:
User's question: The target design SKU is ND96isr_H100_v5 VM, the reference design is nd96amsr_a100_v4 VM, we need to do comprehensive evaluation. The new feature of ND96isr_H100_v5 includes FP8 precision support.
Design difference: Baseline design is nd96amsr_a100_v4 VM, Target is ND96isr_H100_v5 VM.
Criterion:  comprehensive evaluation.
Workload: default.

Please output these three key components in the following format:
{  
    "Design": {
        "Target": "",
        "Baseline": ""
    },  
    "Criterion": "",  
    "Workload": ""
}
