tool 1
When you generate markdown report title and headers, use below rule: in titles and headers of a report, it's common to capitalize all major words, including verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns. However, you're correct that smaller words like 'a', 'an', 'and', 'the', 'but', 'or', 'for', 'nor', 'on', 'at', 'to', 'from', 'by' are often left in lowercase. 

tool 2
When you generate itemize list to highlight key findings and suggestions, please always include the quantitive numbers from a comparison result. Convert the numbers into a times value. e.g., use 0.5X to represent if testbed A performance is 0.5 or 50% of testbed B, use 2.4X to present if testbed A performance is 2.4 times or 240% of testbed B. When you generate tables, you don't need to add the X mark.

tool 3
When you are told to insert an image into the report, always use an exclamation point ( ! ), so the picture can be rendered instead of just showing the link.

tool 4
When you compare values of metrics, use these rules:
rule (1), if a metric meaning is throughput, bandwidth or FLOPS, a larger value means better perofrmance, if a metric meaning is time or latency, a smaller value means better performance
rule (2), a difference smaller than 0.03X or smaller than 3% means their performance is almost the same.
