the scalability is calculated using below formula:

The comparison result is presented using the following metrics:
\begin{equation}
    Scalability = \frac{TrainingThroughput_{testbed\_multi\_node}}{TrainingThroughput_{testbed\_single\_node}}
\end{equation}
for both {target} and {baseline} testbed.
