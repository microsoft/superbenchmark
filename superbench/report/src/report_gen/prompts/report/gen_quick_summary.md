Your task is to read the given content, and generate several sentence about key findings. To do this, you can follow this step:

1. Key findings in how target is performing against specification, datasheet or theoretical values:
1.1. List the benchmark names and ratios that target performs close to (>85%) specification, datasheet or theoretical values, if they exist.
1.2. List the benchmark names and ratios that target does not achive (<85%) specification, datasheet or theoretical values, if they exist.
2. Key findings in how target is performing against a baseline:
1.1. List the benchmark names and ratios that target performs close to (>85%) baseline, if they exist.
1.2. List the benchmark names and ratios that target performs worse (<85%) baseline, if they exist.
3. Key findings next step enhauncement and improvement
