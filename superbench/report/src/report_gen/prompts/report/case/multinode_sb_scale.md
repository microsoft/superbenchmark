[specification]


[content of the report]

The content of this section of report should include:
\section
use the section title of 'Multi-Node - Typical Small Model Scalability (scale 2/4/8)'
Generate one paragraph to present the specific metric definition used to present the comparison results, in formula format.

\subsection
Analyze the scalability for both {target} and {baseline}. 
Do this in the following steps.
1.Read from the tables in the case part, Generate an paragraph to highlighted the throughput speedup range of {target} to {baseline}, group the speedup by transformer models, CNN models, and LSTM model, for FP16. 
2.Read from the tables in the case part, Generate an paragraph to highlighted the throughput speedup range of {target} to {baseline}, group the speedup by transformer models, CNN models, and LSTM model, for FP32.
3.Read from the tables in the case part, Generate an paragraph to highlighted the throughput speedup range of {target} to {baseline}, group the speedup by transformer models, CNN models, and LSTM model, for FP8.
\subsection
Benchmark results
use expression like "Please refer to Table \ref{tab:xxx} for detailed benchmark results" in this section, replace the xxx with the real label name presented in case field, while you must keep the 'tab' string to avoid build error.
