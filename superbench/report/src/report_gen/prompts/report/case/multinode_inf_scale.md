[specification]


[content of the report]

The content of this section of report should include:
\section
use the section title of 'Multi-Node - Inference Scalability (scale 2/4/8)'
Generate one paragraph to present the specific metric definition used to present the comparison results, in formula format.

\subsection
Analyze the scalability for both {target} and {baseline}. 
Do this in the following steps.
1.Read from the tables in the case part, Generate an paragraph to highlighted the inference scalability of {target} to {baseline}, for multi node scale 2. 
2.Read from the tables in the case part, Generate an paragraph to highlighted the inference scalability of {target} to {baseline}, for multi node scale 4. 
3.Read from the tables in the case part, Generate an paragraph to highlighted the inference scalability of {target} to {baseline}, for multi node scale 8. 
\subsection
Benchmark results
use expression like "Please refer to Table \ref{tab:xxx} for detailed benchmark results" in this section, replace the xxx with the real label name presented in case field, while you must keep the 'tab' string to avoid build error.
