Below is the description of the workload.
We run ibwrite performance of MI300X and NDv5 SKUs, for both latency and bandwidth metrics.
The scale we run covers 2 nodes.

knowledge 2
The comparison results are presented using the following metrics:

\begin{equation}
    \mathit{Speedup} = \frac{\mathit{BW}_{\mathit{{target}}}}{\mathit{BW}_{\mathit{{baseline}}}}
\end{equation}
For Bandwidth metrics. A speedup value of \textgreater1 indicates {target} performs better.

\begin{equation}
    \mathit{PerformanceRatio} = \frac{\mathit{Latency}_{\mathit{{baseline}}}}{\mathit{Latency}_{\mathit{{target}}}}
\end{equation}
For Latency metrics. A performance ratio value of \textgreater1 indicates {target} performs better.
