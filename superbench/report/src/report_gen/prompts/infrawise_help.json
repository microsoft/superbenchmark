    "welcome": "Thank you for trying **AIMicius Agent**, your assistant for data-driven decision-making for AI infrastructure design research and tasks.",
    "feature": "Here's how AIMicius can assist you:\n\n1. **Data Retrieval:** AIMicius can process your queries about workload performance on a specific server SKU, delivering the most relevant  benchmark data. For instance, you might ask: 'Can you test the GPT2-large training performance on H100 and MI300x?'\n\n2. **Data Analysis:** AIMicius can execute in-depth analysis on the benchmark data based on your query, empowering you to gain insights and make informed decisions. For instance, you might ask: 'Can you analyze the training throughput of FP16 and FP8, and explain if there are any advantages to changing the precision from FP16 to FP8?' \n\nPlease be aware \n\n (1) A data analysis question can only be processed after a valid data retrieval question, however once you initiate an analysis question, you can continue the analysis by asking follow-up questions.\n\n (2) Please include the term analysis or analyze in your query to trigger an effective analyze session.",
    "sku": "Currently Supported SKU(GPU): NDv5(H100), NDmv4(A100), MI300x(MI300x), with more SKUs to be added soon.",
    "workload": "Currently Supported Benchmarks and Workloads:\n+ GPU compute metrics (kernel launch, GEMM flops for FP64/TF32/FP16/FP8/INT8)\n+ GPU memory metrics (CPU to GPU or GPU to CPU memory copy bandwidth)\n+ CPU metrics (memory bandwidth, memory latency)\n+ Communication metrics (NCCL performance, IB loopback performance, for NDv5 multiple algorithms including AllReduce, AlltoAll, AllGather, ReduceGather are supported)\n+ Training workloads (LSTM, GPT2, BERT, VGG, Resnet, Densenet)",
    "no_data": "AIMicius doen not hold available data to substantiate your inquiry. Our team is working on expanding both the workload and SKU coverage. Please stay tuned for updates",
    "no_previouse_benchmark": "Your analysis query cannot be processed at this moment as there is no prior benchmark query for reference. Please follow the steps below to formulate a benchmarking question prior to conducting any analysis.",
    "unsupported_question": "AIMicius is committed to assisting with your inquiries. However, your current question falls outside our support scope. Please refer to the information below to understand how AIMicius can assist you."
