SuperBench is a benchmarking and diagnosis tool for AI infrastructure,
which supports:
* Comprehensive AI infrastructure validation
    * Distribute validation tools to validate hundreds or thousands of severs automatically
    * Consider both raw hardware and E2E model performance with ML workload patterns
    * Provide a fast and accurate way to detect and locate hardware problems
    * Performance/Quality Gates for hardware and system release
* Benchmarking with typical AI workload patterns
    * Provide comprehensive performance comparison between different existing hardware
    * Give a better understanding for new DL software & hardware
* Detailed performance analysis and diagnosis
    * Provide detailed performance report and advanced analysis tool  Â 

It includes micro-benchmark for primitive computation and communication benchmarking,
and model-benchmark to measure domain-aware end-to-end deep learning workloads.
