SuperBench is a benchmarking and diagnosis tool for AI infrastructure,
which supports:
* Comprehensive AI infrastructure validation
    * Distributed validation tools to validate hundreds or thousands of servers automatically
    * Consider both raw hardware and E2E model performance with ML workload patterns
    * Provide a fast and accurate way to detect and locate hardware problems
    * Performance/Quality Gates for hardware and system release
* Benchmarking with typical AI workload patterns
    * Provide comprehensive performance comparison between different existing hardware
    * Give a better understanding for new DL software & hardware
* Detailed performance analysis and diagnosis
    * Provide detailed performance report and advanced analysis tool  Â 

It includes micro-benchmark for primitive computation and communication benchmarking,
and model-benchmark to measure domain-aware end-to-end deep learning workloads.


## Installation

### Using Python

System requirements:
* Python: Python 3.6 or later, pip 18.0 or later
* Platform: Ubuntu 16.04 or later (64-bit), Windows 10 (64-bit) with WSL2

Check whether Python environment is already configured:
```sh
# check Python version
python3 --version
# check pip version
python3 -m pip --version
```
If not, install the followings:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
* [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

It's recommended to use a virtual environment (optional):
```sh
# create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ./venv
# activate the virtual environment
source ./venv/bin/activate

# exit the virtual environment later
# after you finish running superbench
deactivate
```

Then install superbench through either PyPI binary or from source:

1. PyPI Binary

    TODO

2. From Source

    ```sh
    # get source code
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/superbenchmark
    cd superbenchmark

    # install superbench
    python3 -m pip install .
    ```

## Developer Guide

Follow [Installation using Python](#using-python) and
use [`dev` branch](https://github.com/microsoft/superbenchmark/tree/dev).

### Set Up

```sh
# get dev branch code
git clone -b dev https://github.com/microsoft/superbenchmark
cd superbenchmark

# install superbench
python3 -m pip install -e .[dev,test]
```

### Lint and Test

```sh
# format code using yapf
python3 setup.py format

# check code style with mypy and flake8
python3 setup.py lint

# run all unit tests
python3 setup.py test
```

### Submit a Pull Request

Please install `pre-commit` before `git commit` to run all pre-checks.

```sh
pre-commit install
```

Pull requests should be submitted to [`dev` branch](https://github.com/microsoft/superbenchmark/tree/dev).
