SuperBench is a benchmarking and diagnosis tool for AI infrastructure,
which supports:
* Comprehensive AI infrastructure validation
    * Distributed validation tools to validate hundreds or thousands of servers automatically
    * Consider both raw hardware and E2E model performance with ML workload patterns
    * Provide a fast and accurate way to detect and locate hardware problems
    * Performance/Quality Gates for hardware and system release
* Benchmarking with typical AI workload patterns
    * Provide comprehensive performance comparison between different existing hardware
    * Give a better understanding for new DL software & hardware
* Detailed performance analysis and diagnosis
    * Provide detailed performance report and advanced analysis tool  Â 

It includes micro-benchmark for primitive computation and communication benchmarking,
and model-benchmark to measure domain-aware end-to-end deep learning workloads.

> ðŸ”´ __Note__:
SuperBench is in the early pre-alpha stage for open source, and not ready for general public yet.
If you want to jump in early, you can try building latest code yourself.


## Installation

### Using Docker (_Preferred_)

__System Requirements__

* Platform: Ubuntu 18.04 or later (64-bit)
* Docker: Docker CE 19.03 or later

__Install SuperBench__

* Using Pre-Build Images

    ```sh
    docker pull superbench/superbench:dev-cuda11.1.1
    docker run -it --rm \
        --privileged --net=host --ipc=host --gpus=all \
        superbench/superbench:dev-cuda11.1.1 bash
    ```

* Building the Image

    ```sh
    docker build -f dockerfile/cuda11.1.1.dockerfile -t superbench/superbench:dev .
    ```

### Using Python

__System Requirements__

* Platform: Ubuntu 18.04 or later (64-bit); Windows 10 (64-bit) with WSL2
* Python: Python 3.6 or later, pip 18.0 or later

    Check whether Python environment is already configured:
    ```sh
    # check Python version
    python3 --version
    # check pip version
    python3 -m pip --version
    ```
    If not, install the followings:
    * [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    * [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
    * [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment (optional):
    ```sh
    # create a new virtual environment
    python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ./venv
    # activate the virtual environment
    source ./venv/bin/activate

    # exit the virtual environment later
    # after you finish running superbench
    deactivate
    ```

__Install SuperBench__

* PyPI Binary

    ```sh
    # not available yet
    ```

* From Source

    ```sh
    # get source code
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/superbenchmark
    cd superbenchmark

    # install superbench
    python3 -m pip install .
    make postinstall
    ```


## Usage

### Run SuperBench

```sh
# run benchmarks in default settings
sb exec

# use a custom config
sb exec --config-file ./superbench/config/default.yaml
```

### Benchmark Gallary
